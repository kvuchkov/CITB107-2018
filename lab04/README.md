# Lab 4
This lab is an introduction to control flow in C++ - loops and conditional statements.

## Problem 1
Take the problem from Lab #3 and rewrite it with the help of loops and if-statements to achieve the following:
 * Print an error if the amount paid is less then the purchase total and terminate the program.
 * Display only the relevant units, i.e. do not display that the cashier should return 0 x 100 BGN. 
 * Make the program shorted and remove duplicated code for computing and displaying count of units (banknotes and coins).
